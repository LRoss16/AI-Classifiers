# AI-Classifiers
This compares the accuracy of the classifiers Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Two datasets were used for this, the spam dataset and 20 newsgroups dataset. The 20 newsgroups is much larger than the spam dataset with multiple categories, in order to save time, only 6 categories were used. 

This was done Python with Jupyter Notebook.

With the datasets included, you will be able to run this easily.
